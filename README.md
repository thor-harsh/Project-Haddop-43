**In this project We will use Spark with Python to do an amazing stuff.Here we will work on the NLP with Spark to classify emails as SPAM and HAM.** <br></br>


**Before jumping to the code lets understand Spark and NLP(Natural Language Processing) First**...<br></br>

**What is Apache Spark?** <br></br>

Apache Spark‚Ñ¢ is a multi-language engine for executing data engineering, data science, and machine learning on single-node machines or clusters.<br></br>
Unify the processing of your data in batches and real-time streaming, using your preferred language: Python, SQL, Scala, Java or R.
Execute fast, distributed ANSI SQL queries for dashboarding and ad-hoc reporting. Runs faster than most data warehouses.<br></br>
Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on petabyte-scale data without having to resort to downsampling.
Train machine learning algorithms on a laptop and use the same code to scale to fault-tolerant clusters of thousands of machines.<br></br>

**What is Spark DataFrames**?<br></br>

**1**: Spark 2.0 shifted towards DataFrame syntax<br></br>
**2**: are now the standard way of using Spark's ML Capabilties<br></br>
**3**: Spark Docs are still new<br></br>
**4**: DataFrame is very familiar to Pandas DataFrames<br></br>
**5**: Columns = features<br></br>
**6**: Rows = records<br></br>

**What is Natural Language Processing**?<br></br>
Natural language processing is an interdisciplinary subfield of computer science and linguistics. It is primarily concerned with giving computers the ability to support and manipulate human language.<br></br>

NLP combines computational linguistics‚Äîrule-based modeling of human language‚Äîwith statistical, machine learning, and deep learning models. Together, these technologies enable computers to process human language in the form of text or voice data and to ‚Äòunderstand‚Äô its full meaning, complete with the speaker or writer‚Äôs intent and sentiment.<br></br>

NLP drives computer programs that translate text from one language to another, respond to spoken commands, and summarize large volumes of text rapidly‚Äîeven in real time. There‚Äôs a good chance you‚Äôve interacted with NLP in the form of voice-operated GPS systems, digital assistants, speech-to-text dictation software, customer service chatbots, and other consumer conveniences. But NLP also plays a growing role in enterprise solutions that help streamline business operations, increase employee productivity, and simplify mission-critical business processes.<br></br>
